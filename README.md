## 🎓 Learning Objectives

- Master full-stack development with custom authentication
- Handle secure file uploads and private access
- Manage user roles and access rights
- Deploy and secure a Node.js app on a dedicated server
- Deliver a solo project at production quality

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Rationale

### ⚙️ Frontend – **Next.js**
- React framework with SSR, API routes, static export
- Built-in routing and performance optimization

### 🎨 Styling – **Tailwind CSS**
- Utility-first framework for fast, responsive UI
- Consistent styling directly in JSX

### 🧠 Language – **TypeScript**
- Static typing, better IDE support
- Fewer runtime bugs, easier maintenance

### 🔙 Backend – **Node.js + Express**
- Fast, minimalist backend server
- Ideal for REST APIs and custom middleware

### 🗃️ Database – **MongoDB + Mongoose**
- Flexible NoSQL for evolving logic
- Mongoose for structure and validation

### 🔐 Auth – **Custom Authentication System**
- JWT login with secure sessions and cookies
- Full control over logic and roles (admin, user)
- Zero third-party dependencies

### 🧾 File Storage – **VPS + Cloudflare**
- Supporting documents stored on private server
- Cloudflare protection (DDoS, WAF, access rules)
- Full control over access, naming, expiration

### 🗂️ Project Management – **Trello**
- Kanban for scope, tasks, deadlines
- Weekly tracking over 4 weeks

### 🛠️ DevOps – **GitHub + CI/CD**
- Versioning and collaboration
- Vercel (frontend) + custom VPS (backend + files)
- GitHub Actions for deployment and testing
